## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Get Your Google API Key

1. Go to https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Copy the key

### Step 2: Create .env File

```powershell
# In the business_bot folder
Copy-Item .env.example .env
# Then edit .env and paste your API key
```

Your `.env` should look like:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...your_actual_key_here
```

### Step 3: Run Setup Script

```powershell
cd business_bot
.\setup.ps1
```

This will:

- Install all dependencies
- Generate the business PDF
- Verify everything is in place

## 🎯 Running the Application

### Option A: Standalone App (Easiest)

```powershell
python app.py
```

Then open http://localhost:7860 in your browser!

### Option B: Jupyter Notebook (Full Experience)

```powershell
jupyter notebook business_agent.ipynb
```

Then run all cells (Cell → Run All)

## 🧪 What to Test

Once running, try these queries in the chat:

1. **Information Query**

   - "What services do you offer?"
   - "Tell me about your membership options"

2. **Lead Collection** (provides name & email)

   - "I'm interested in joining. My name is John Smith and email is john@example.com"

3. **Check Schedules**

   - "What yoga classes are available on Monday?"
   - "When are the HIIT classes?"

4. **Book Trial**

   - "I want to book a trial session"
   - (Agent will ask for details)

5. **Feedback**
   - "The gym was amazing today!"
   - (Creates a feedback ticket)

## 📁 Check Generated Files

After testing, you'll see these new files:

- `leads.txt` - Customer interest records
- `feedback.txt` - Feedback tickets
- `bookings.txt` - Trial session bookings

   - Saves to: feedback.txt
   - Use case: "Great gym!" or "Problem with..."

3. **book_trial_session**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "GOOGLE_API_KEY not found"

```powershell
# Make sure .env file exists in business_bot folder
cat .env
# Should show: GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### "Module not found"

```powershell
# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Gradio Won't Launch

```powershell
# Try different port
python -c "from app import demo; demo.launch(server_port=7861)"
```

### PDF Won't Generate

```powershell
# Make sure reportlab is installed
pip install reportlab
python generate_pdf.py
```

## 📚 Understanding the Code

### System Prompt

The agent uses a comprehensive system prompt that:

- Defines its role as FitFusion's assistant
- Provides business information
- Instructs when to use each tool
- Sets the tone (friendly, motivating, professional)

### Tool Calling Flow

1. User sends message → Agent (Gemini)
2. Agent decides if tool needed
3. If yes → Calls tool function
4. Tool executes → Returns result
5. Agent receives result → Formulates response
6. User gets friendly response with tool action completed

### Gradio Interface

- **ChatInterface**: Simple chat UI
- **Examples**: Pre-made queries users can click
- **Theme**: Soft theme for welcoming feel
- **Height**: 500px chatbot for good visibility

## 🚢 Deployment (Bonus)

### HuggingFace Spaces

1. Create account at huggingface.co
2. New Space → Choose Gradio SDK
3. Upload: app.py, requirements.txt, README.md
4. Add Secret: GOOGLE_API_KEY
5. Auto-deploys!
